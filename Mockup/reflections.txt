The biggest skill I have learned is how html is used to create the look of a web page. I have found that the basics of html is pretty easy to understand, however using those in creative was to give a website its style can be difficult. I have used the first lesson to understand that this may be diffiuclt, but it is something that I am capable of learning. If I break down the problem into its simplist form and search for answers using the forums and external websites.
